# Goals
1. Do Nand2Tetris
2. Do Nand2Tetris FPGA version


--- 

## 2025-11-14
- got the board working (took forever lol)
- need to finish out last chips in verilog
- read chapter 2 of Nand2Tetris

## 2025-11-08
- cleaned up github repo and added fpga code 
- implemented NOT in verilog
- AND working in v
- need right usb cable for board

## 2025-11-07
- Already got hardware for fpga lol but need to do classic N2T first (maybe in parallel? check after finishing C1)
- Doing N2T Chapter 1
- Finished all the gates, didn't do the full reading (maybe later)
- TODO: check if fpga chapter 1 is doable now - should be - DO NEXT
